    <p>You are John McCain, trader in crypto-currency and scammer in his spare time. <br>
    This saturday morning, you decided to stay in bed late, to rest from your very busy week.
    Suddenly, a very heavy noise wakes you up at 6:00 am. 
    You look through the window and see a dozen of FBI agents, destroying your front door to break in.
    They are here to take the money that you have been saving by not giving it to the state. Fealthy them!
    You won't let them take your money, and even less yourself.
    You can either go open the door and play innoncent, hide in the closet, escape through the window, or go to your garage.<br>
    If you want to open the door, go to chapter <a href="#chapter32">32</a>.<br> If you want to hide in the closet, go to chapter <a href="#chapter60">60</a>.<br>
    If you want to escape through the window, go to chapter <a href="#chapter17">17</a>.<br> If you want to go to your garage, go to chapter <a href="#chapter86">86</a>.

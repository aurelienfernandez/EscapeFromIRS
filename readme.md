Once you landed, join your partner on the nearest road, kill him at the first stop he makes, as he will betray you by delivering you to the police, and take his car.

#### Step 9

Now that you are in Mexico, bribe anybody you run through, or you will be either killed, arrested, get your money stolen, or reported to the FBI.
